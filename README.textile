h1. Justification

I started my search by looking for available upload extensions for Radiant CMS. The most popular one I found was Paperclipped. After some trail runs with Paperclipped I wasn’t satisfied. I found that it was trying to be too smart for my good. I think my clients need something simple. They just want the ability to upload files and reference them in their web pages. To me that sounds like an web based scp/ftp application. This extension is the first step in that direction.
