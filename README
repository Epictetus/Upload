Justification
  - I started my search by looking for available upload extensions for Radiant CMS. The most popular one I found was Paperclipped. After some trail runs with Paperclipped I wasn’t satisfied. I found that it was trying to be too smart for my good. I think my clients need something simple. They just want the ability to upload files and reference them in their web pages. To me that sounds like an web based scp/ftp application. This extension is the first step in that direction.

What’s next?
  - I will be adding more features as the needs come in. Currently, there isn’t any exception handling. You must create “public/upload” folder or the extension will not start. But other than those two items, it works perfectly.

Getting Started
  1. Download the source code with: git clone git://github.com/buwilliams/file-upload.git
  2. Copy the code into your (radiant)/vendor/extension/ directory
  3. Create your upload folder at (radiant)/public/upload
  4. Visit the radiant site and click on the Files tab.

Support
  - If you have any ideas or change requests please send me an email at buddy [at] buddylee [dot] org and I’ll be happy to update the source code.
